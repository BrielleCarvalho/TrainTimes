# TrainTimes 
This page will track and save trains arriving in a database.
When we add a train, it will save the train name, destination, frequency, the next arrival time, and how many minutes away the train is!

Refresh the page, your train information is still there and you can continue to add new trains!

The site will also update in real time!
